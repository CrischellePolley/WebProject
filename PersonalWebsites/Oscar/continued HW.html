         style="color:red"<h1>My name is Oscar Reyes, and I am a computer science major, I am currently 
	a fulltime employee and a fulltime student as well. 
	I hope to graduate this December and hopefully find a job soon in the tech industry. 
	Some of my favorite hobbies are outdoor activities. 
	My favorite being hiking and skydiving. I love the thrill and adrenaline of extreme sports. 
	I am not very skilled at the moment with coding, but a little more practice will get me 
	where I need to be. Being a fulltime employee as well as a fulltime student leaves very little
	time for me to practice and get better, I do expect that once I am done with school, 
	I will be able to really dive into more coding and dedicate more time to coding. 
	I love to learn new things and develop new skills, especially if they can be of any help to my community.
	When I graduate, I want to continue to further my education 
	by pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in artificial intelligence. 
	Eventually I want to focus my career on the field of artificial intelligence. 
	My goal is to land a job within a well established company so that I can farther develop 
	my coding skills.</h1>
