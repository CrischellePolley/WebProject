		<p>My name is Crischelle Polley, and I am 23 years old. I am a Computer Science major in my senior year. When it comes to my future career, 
		I have no specific job title in mind. But, I do want to gain many hard skills that will aid me in getting any position in the computer 
		science field. My goal is to be a jack-of-all-trades in the beginning stages before I settle on one field.</p>

		<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
		<p>In my current Software Engineering course, me and my group members are working on developing an Apartment Services System software
		which is a very basic construct. I hope to continue developing it further in the future. As a current resident of an apartment complex, 
		I think this would be an incredibly handy resource that help the tenants and staff to communicate better.</p>
